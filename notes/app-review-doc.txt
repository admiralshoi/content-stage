An agent is the "brand user" / connected instagram business account.
By clicking the chaticon bottom right corner a user can open a chat, where he can view different conversations with creators as well as see messages and reply to them

We show the attached media sent through the webhook along with a message saying "'user' replied to your story: {{message}}", where the {{message}} is the message that was replied

We show the attached media with a message below it saying "'user' mentioned you in their story"

As our we receive the webhook suggesting a message has been unsent / deleted, we update the "status" in our database to deleted, as such replacing the text message with a "Message has been deleted" message, which we are showing in a cursive format in the chat. Any story or otherwise attached media will also be removed and not displayed anymore.

For story expirations (or essentially removal of "media" which doesn't send a "deletion" webhook) the media will simply stop being displayed in the chat, although the message saying that a user mentioned them in their story etc will persist, similar to how does in the real Instagram inbox as well.
